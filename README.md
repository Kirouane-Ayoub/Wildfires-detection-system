About this Project : 

The Wildfire Smoke Detection and Tracking System is a high-tech solution that uses drones or HPWREN cameras equipped with the YOLOv5 algorithm to detect and alert individuals of potential wildfire smoke in the surrounding area. The system is designed to work in real-time, constantly monitoring the environment and providing accurate and timely notifications of any smoke detected. The use of drones allows for a wider coverage area and the ability to access hard-to-reach areas while HPWREN cameras are utilized to monitor remote areas that are at high risk of wildfire. The YOLOv5 algorithm is a powerful machine learning tool that is able to detect and classify objects in real-time, making it a valuable tool in detecting smoke and preventing the spread of wildfire.
